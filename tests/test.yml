###### PRODUCT_NAME = api-mgr | esb | dss | msg-broker #######
# Since version 6.0.0 the WSO2 integrator product contains: esb, dss and msg-broker, 
# but it's possible to install each product on separated instances. If you need to do so, just run the playbook 
# with the accordingly PRODUCT_NAME. If you want to install the integrator with all products on the same instance, 
# you could use "esb" or "dss" as PRODUCT_NAME and you will have the complete integrator install. 

# The "msg-broker" has a separated folder and start scripts that are under the #integrator root folder 
# and you should use it on PRODUCT_NAME if you want to install specifically it.
